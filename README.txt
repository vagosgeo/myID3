myID3 Machine Learning Algorithm
-------------

Created a machine learning algorithm, that combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result.
Specifically, this algorithm has as inputs some movies' reviews and it was being trained in order to be capable to decide if the review is negative or positive.
Then we compared the results of myID3 with Random Forest algorithm results.
